Navigation Component / Navigation Graph

fragment >> intent
A fragment is a reusable piece of UI.

The fragment lifecycle has five states, represented by the Lifecycle.State enum.

INITIALIZED: A new instance of the fragment has been instantiated.
CREATED: The first fragment lifecycle methods are called. During this state, the view associated with the fragment is also created.
STARTED: The fragment is visible onscreen but does not have "focus", meaning it can't respond to user input.
RESUMED: The fragment is visible and has focus.
DESTROYED: The fragment object has been de-instantiated.

onCreate(): The fragment has been instantiated and is in the CREATED state. However, its corresponding view has not been created yet.
onCreateView(): This method is where you inflate the layout. The fragment has entered the CREATED state.
onViewCreated(): This is called after the view is created. In this method, you would typically bind specific views to properties by calling findViewById().
onStart(): The fragment has entered the STARTED state.
onResume(): The fragment has entered the RESUMED state and now has focus (can respond to user input).
onPause(): The fragment has re-entered the STARTED state. The UI is visible to the user
onStop(): The fragment has re-entered the CREATED state. The object is instantiated but is no longer presented on screen.
onDestroyView(): Called right before the fragment enters the DESTROYED state. The view has already been removed from memory, but the fragment object still exists.
onDestroy(): The fragment enters the DESTROYED state.

Each fragment consists of two filesâ€”an XML file for the layout and a Kotlin class to display data and handle user interactions.

Intent

2 types : implicit & explicit

explicit : highly specific
    >> exact activity to be launched, often a screen in your own app.
implicit : abstract
    >>  tell the system the type of action, such as opening a link, composing an email, or making a phone call, and the system is responsible for figuring out how to fulfill the request.


val context = holder.view.context
val intent = Intent(context, DetailActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("letter", holder.button.text.toString())
context.startActivity(intent)



val letterId = intent?.extras?.getString("letter").toString()

If your app tries to access a property or call a function on a null object, the app will crash.To safely access this value, you put a ? after the name.


URI 
Uniform Resource Identifier

>> string that points to a webpage
    val queryUrl: Uri = Uri.parse("${DetailActivity.SEARCH_PREFIX}${item}")
